Help me write a more clear  way of requesting help;  Below is my initial attempt, and the goal of this is to assist me in getting better AI  results. Also help me, if needed, break this into separated AI work sessions.


Please review the ~/code/banno/responsive-tiles Start by reading the ~/code/banno/responsive-tiles/specs/PFM-API-DOCS.md file

This document is a bit of stream of consciousness and ideas that i would like to achieve.

There are also some tangential, yet related goals I would like to achieve mixed in with the below list of goals.

IMPORTANT TO NOTE:
`Client API Access`: The ~/code/banno/responsive-tiles/api/src/api contents are for the Client access not the API endpoints
`Backend API Endpoints`: The ~/code/banno/responsive-tiles/specs/pfm_api_docs.yaml is, a possible outdated, but should be an accurate representation of the API endpoints used by the `Client API Access`

The Gap Analysis between `Client API Access` and the `Backend API Endpoints` should always know the `Client API Access` is the 'API Source of Truth` (ASOT).   


Goals:
1. Get clarity on helping me get to what my true goals are.
2. Help me understand the options available to reach my goal
3. Document responsive-tiles project business rules, refer to the ~/code/banno/specs/BUSINESS-RULES-GUIDANCE.md for clarity. Include a critique where you see these guidance rules fall short of the BUSINESS-RULES-GUIDANCE.md doc.
4. Determine how accurate the ~/code/banno/responsive-tiles/spec/pfm_api_docs.yaml is relative to the existing ~/code/banno/responsive-tiles/src/api contents
