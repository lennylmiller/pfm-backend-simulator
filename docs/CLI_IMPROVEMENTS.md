# CLI Improvements - Services Management

## Problem Solved

The CLI Quick Start workflow had a critical UX issue:
1. After starting all services (Caddy, backend, responsive-tiles), the CLI returned to the menu
2. Services continued running in the background with no visibility
3. Users pressing Ctrl+C would exit the CLI but leave services running
4. Caddy processes running as root were difficult to stop manually
5. No easy way to stop all services from the CLI

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Graceful Shutdown with Ctrl+C
- **File**: `tools/cli/modules/cleanup.ts` (new)
- **What it does**: Intercepts SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM signals
- **Behavior**: Stops all running services before exiting
- **User experience**: Press Ctrl+C anywhere in the CLI to cleanly stop everything

### 2. Services Status Display
- **Where**: Main menu banner
- **What it shows**: Real-time status of all 3 services
- **Format**:
  ```
  ðŸ“Š Services Status:
    âœ… Caddy (port 443)        [if running]
    âšª Backend (port 3000)      [if stopped]
    âœ… Responsive-tiles (port 8080)
  ```

### 3. Stop All Services Menu Option
- **Location**: Main menu (second option after Quick Start)
- **What it does**: Stops all running services with one selection
- **Confirmation**: Shows count of services stopped
- **Safe**: Can be called multiple times (idempotent)

### 4. Improved Workflow Completion
- **Enhanced messaging**: Clear instructions on how to manage services
- **Tips displayed**:
  - Services continue running in background
  - How to stop them (menu or Ctrl+C)
  - What to do next

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `tools/cli/modules/cleanup.ts` - Services cleanup and status utilities

### Modified Files
- `tools/cli/index.ts` - Main CLI with signal handlers and stop menu
- `tools/cli/workflows/quickStart.ts` - Improved completion messaging

## Usage

### Starting Services
```bash
npm run cli
# Select: "ðŸš€ Quick Start Workflow"
# Services start automatically
# Return to menu with all services running
```

### Checking Services Status
```bash
# Status is displayed automatically in main menu
ðŸ“Š Services Status:
  âœ… Caddy (port 443)
  âœ… Backend (port 3000)
  âœ… Responsive-tiles (port 8080)
```

### Stopping Services

**Option 1: From Menu**
```bash
# From main menu, select:
"ðŸ›‘ Stop All Services"
```

**Option 2: Ctrl+C (Anywhere)**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C at any time
# CLI will:
# 1. Stop responsive-tiles
# 2. Stop backend
# 3. Stop Caddy (with sudo)
# 4. Exit gracefully
```

**Option 3: Manual**
```bash
sudo pkill -f "caddy run"
pkill -f "node.*dist/index.js"
pkill -f "npm start"
```

## Technical Details

### Signal Handling
```typescript
// Setup in tools/cli/index.ts
cleanup.setupSignalHandlers();

// Defined in tools/cli/modules/cleanup.ts
process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
  await stopAllServices();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

### Service Detection
- **Backend**: Checks global process reference
- **Caddy**: Checks port 443 binding
- **Responsive-tiles**: Checks global process reference

### Shutdown Order
1. Responsive-tiles (user process)
2. Backend (user process)
3. Caddy (root process with sudo)

## Benefits

### User Experience
- âœ… No more orphaned processes
- âœ… Clear visibility into what's running
- âœ… One-click stop from menu
- âœ… Ctrl+C works as expected
- âœ… No manual process hunting

### Developer Experience
- âœ… Clean development workflow
- âœ… Easy to restart services
- âœ… No port conflicts from old processes
- âœ… Professional CLI behavior

### Production Ready
- âœ… Proper signal handling
- âœ… Graceful shutdown
- âœ… Error handling for failed stops
- âœ… Idempotent operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:
1. **Service restart**: Restart individual services without full workflow
2. **Service logs**: View logs from running services
3. **Health checks**: Automatic health monitoring with alerts
4. **Process persistence**: Store PIDs to file for cross-session management
5. **Systemd integration**: Optional systemd service files for Linux
