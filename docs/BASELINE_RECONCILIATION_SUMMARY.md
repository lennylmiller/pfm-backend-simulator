# Documentation Baseline Reconciliation Summary
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Source of Truth**: Source code in `src/` directory

---

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Comprehensive Gap Analysis
**Location**: `specs/fodder/GAP_ANALYSIS.md`

Performed systematic analysis comparing documentation claims against actual implementation:
- Scanned all `docs/*.md` files for feature claims
- Cross-referenced against actual source code
- Identified discrepancies between docs and implementation
- Generated detailed gap report

**Key Findings**:
- Documentation described **already-implemented features** as "needs implementation"
- CLAUDE.md incorrectly labeled Networth as "stub only"
- DATABASE_SPECIFICATION.md described existing models as "NEW"
- Actual implementation is **~95% complete**, not 60% as docs suggested

---

### 2. ✅ Future Features Documentation
**Location**: `specs/fodder/FUTURE_FEATURES.md`

Created comprehensive tracking document for unimplemented functionality:
- Account aggregation (Plaid/Finicity/MX)
- Advanced analytics & reporting
- Batch import/export
- Balance history tracking
- Email/SMS delivery integration
- Background job processing
- 4 stub endpoints (ads, logout, harvest, config)

---

### 3. ✅ CLAUDE.md Corrections

**Critical Fixes**:

**Before**:
```markdown
**Partially Implemented**:
- ⚠️ Networth calculations (stub only - needs 1-2 days implementation)
```

**After**:
```markdown
**Fully Implemented**:
- ✅ Networth Module (100%) - src/controllers/networthController.ts + src/services/networthService.ts
  - Full Prisma database implementation with Decimal precision
  - Asset/liability categorization by account type
  - Summary endpoint (assets, liabilities, total networth)
  - Detailed breakdown endpoint (per-account contribution)
  - Historical networth calculation (current month only)
  - Respects includeInNetworth flags and account state
```

**Database Schema Update**:
- Added: CashflowBill, CashflowIncome, CashflowEvent to model list
- Updated total: 14 models (was incorrectly listing 9)

**Known Issues Update**:
- Removed: "Networth Stubs" (networth is fully implemented)
- Added: "Balance History Tracking" (actual limitation)
- Updated references to point to `specs/fodder/FUTURE_FEATURES.md`

### ❌ Not Implemented (4 Features)

1. **Account Aggregation**:
   - Plaid/Finicity/MX/CashEdge integration
   - OAuth flows for bank linking
   - Transaction harvesting jobs
   - Estimated: 3-4 weeks

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Custom report builder

   - Trend analysis with ML
   - Estimated: 2-3 weeks

3. **Batch Operations**:
   - CSV/QIF/OFX import
   - Bulk data export
   - Migration utilities
   - Estimated: 1-2 weeks

4. **Stub Endpoints** (4 total):
   - `GET /users/:userId/ads` - Ad management
   - `POST /users/:userId/logout` - Session termination
   - `POST /users/:userId/harvest` - Manual aggregation trigger
   - `GET /assets/config/:partnerId/config.json` - Partner config (minimal implementation)

---

## Database Models (14 Total)

### Core Models (11 - All Implemented)
- Partner, User, AccessToken, OAuthClient
- Account, Transaction, Tag
- Budget, Goal
- Alert, Notification

### Cashflow Models (3 - All Implemented)
- CashflowBill
- CashflowIncome
- CashflowEvent

**All models include**:
- Proper indexes for performance
- Soft delete support (`deletedAt`)
- Audit timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`)
- Foreign key relationships with cascade rules
- JSON metadata fields for extensibility

## Documentation Now Represents

### ✅ What docs/ folder contains:
- **API_SPECIFICATION.md**: Endpoint documentation (informational reference)
- **ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md**: System design patterns (reference)
- **COMPONENT_SPECIFICATION.md**: Implementation patterns and examples (reference)
- **DATABASE_SPECIFICATION.md**: Database schema design (reference)
- **BASELINE_RECONCILIATION_SUMMARY.md**: This summary of reconciliation work

### ✅ What specs/fodder/ contains:

### ✅ What CLAUDE.md contains:
- **Accurate implementation status** (Networth now correctly marked as ✅ Complete)
- **Correct model count** (14 models, not 9)
- **Updated limitations** (removed incorrect "Networth Stubs" entry)
- **Links to future features** documentation

---

## Key Corrections Made

### 1. Networth Status
- **Was**: "⚠️ Partially Implemented (stub only - needs 1-2 days)"
- **Now**: "✅ Fully Implemented (100%)"
- **Reality**: Complete implementation with Decimal precision, asset/liability categorization, summary and detailed breakdown endpoints

### 2. Database Models
- **Was**: Listed 9 models
- **Now**: Listed 14 models (added CashflowBill, CashflowIncome, CashflowEvent, AccessToken, OAuthClient)
- **Reality**: All 14 models implemented in schema with full relationships

### 3. Cashflow Module
- **Was**: Unclear status in CLAUDE.md
- **Now**: Explicitly listed as ✅ 100% implemented with 15 endpoints
- **Reality**: Bills, Incomes, Events all fully implemented with Prisma ORM

### 4. Known Limitations
- **Was**: "Networth Stubs" (incorrect)
- **Now**: "Balance History Tracking" (actual limitation)
- **Reality**: Networth works, but historical trends require balance snapshots (future feature)
