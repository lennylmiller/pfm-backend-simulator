# Caddy Reverse Proxy Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### Goal
Make pfm-backend-simulator a **drop-in replacement** for the staging backend without modifying responsive-tiles, matching the staging workflow pattern.

### Problem Identified
- Responsive-tiles constructs URLs as `https://pfm.backend.simulator.com` (HTTPS, no port)
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:3000` (HTTP with port 3000)
- Mismatch caused ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors

### Solution: Caddy Reverse Proxy
Instead of changing responsive-tiles, we make the backend accessible via HTTPS on port 443 using Caddy.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Caddy Installation ✅
```bash
brew install caddy
```

### 2. Caddyfile Configuration ✅
Created `/Users/LenMiller/code/pfm-backend-simulator/Caddyfile`:
- Maps HTTPS port 443 to HTTP port 3000
- Self-signed TLS certificates via Caddy internal CA
- CORS headers for localhost:8080
- JSON logging to logs/caddy.log

### 3. CLI Integration ✅
Created `tools/cli/modules/caddyManager.ts`:
- `startCaddy()` - Launch Caddy with Caddyfile
- `stopCaddy()` - Graceful shutdown
- `checkCaddyInstalled()` - Verify installation
- `getCaddyInfo()` - Process status
- `displayCaddyStatus()` - User-friendly status display

### 4. Workflow Integration ✅
Updated `tools/cli/workflows/quickStart.ts`:
- Added Caddy check before workflow starts
- Added Step 6: Start Caddy reverse proxy
- Updated success summary to show HTTPS endpoint
- Integrated into existing workflow seamlessly

### 5. Type Definitions ✅
Updated `tools/cli/types/workflow.ts`:
- Added `caddyProcess?: ProcessInfo` to `WorkflowContext`
- Maintains type safety across workflow

### 6. Build Configuration ✅
Fixed `tsconfig.json`:
- Changed `rootDir` from `./` to `./src`
- Ensures `dist/index.js` exists (not `dist/src/index.js`)
- Resolved "Cannot find module" error

### 7. Documentation ✅
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/CADDY_INTEGRATION.md` - Full setup guide
- `docs/CADDY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### 8. Bug Fixes ✅
Reverted incorrect changes:
- `tools/cli/modules/responsiveTilesManager.ts:41` - Now uses `domain` parameter instead of hardcoded value
- Removed all responsive-tiles modifications (user had already done this)

## How It Works

### Request Flow
```
1. Browser loads: http://localhost:8080 (webpack-dev-server)
2. Responsive-tiles makes API call: https://pfm.backend.simulator.com/api/v2/users/443/accounts
3. Caddy receives HTTPS request on port 443
4. Caddy proxies to: http://localhost:3000/api/v2/users/443/accounts
5. Backend responds
6. Caddy returns response via HTTPS
7. Responsive-tiles receives data
```

### How Domain is Set
```
CLI Workflow:
1. Generates JWT secret
2. Passes PARTNER_DOMAIN='pfm.backend.simulator.com' to responsive-tiles
3. Webpack creates JWT with aud='pfm.backend.simulator.com'
4. Responsive-tiles reads JWT, sets auth.host from aud claim
5. All API calls use auth.host → https://pfm.backend.simulator.com
```

## Testing Results

### Manual Tests ✅
1. **Backend Direct (HTTP)**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   # ✅ {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:37:17.374Z"}
   ```

2. **Through Caddy (HTTPS)**:
   ```bash
   curl -k https://pfm.backend.simulator.com/health
   # ✅ {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:37:39.095Z"}
   ```

3. **Backend Logs Show Caddy Headers**:
   ```
   "via": "2.0 Caddy"
   "x-forwarded-proto": "https"
   "x-forwarded-host": "pfm.backend.simulator.com"
   ```

## Next Steps for User

### To Test End-to-End
1. Run the CLI Quick Start workflow:
   ```bash
   npm run cli
   # Select: Quick Start Workflow
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:8080

3. Verify in browser console:
   - API calls go to `https://pfm.backend.simulator.com`
   - No ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors
   - All API requests succeed

### What to Expect
- Caddy starts automatically
- Backend starts on port 3000
- Responsive-tiles starts on port 8080
- All services work together seamlessly
- No responsive-tiles modifications needed

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ Caddy installed via homebrew
- ✅ Caddyfile created with correct configuration
- ✅ Caddy manager module implemented
- ✅ Quick Start workflow updated
- ✅ TypeScript types updated
- ✅ Build configuration fixed
- ✅ Manual tests pass (HTTP and HTTPS)
- ✅ Responsive-tiles remains unmodified
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ⏳ End-to-end test with responsive-tiles (ready for user)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `Caddyfile`
- `tools/cli/modules/caddyManager.ts`
- `docs/CADDY_INTEGRATION.md`
- `docs/CADDY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `logs/` directory (already in .gitignore)

### Modified
- `tools/cli/workflows/quickStart.ts` - Added Caddy integration
- `tools/cli/types/workflow.ts` - Added caddyProcess field
- `tools/cli/modules/responsiveTilesManager.ts` - Fixed hardcoded domain (line 41)
- `tsconfig.json` - Fixed build output structure

### User Reverted (Correctly)
- `responsive-tiles/src/consumer.ejs` - Removed my incorrect changes ✅
- `responsive-tiles/.env` - Deleted (not needed) ✅

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Why Caddy over nginx?**
   - Automatic HTTPS with self-signed certs
   - Zero configuration for certificates
   - Simple Caddyfile syntax
   - Easy installation via homebrew

2. **Why reverse proxy instead of modifying responsive-tiles?**
   - Maintains "drop-in replacement" goal
   - No responsive-tiles changes needed
   - Matches staging architectural pattern
   - Future-proof (works with responsive-tiles updates)

3. **Why integrate into CLI workflow?**
   - Automatic process management
   - User doesn't need to remember manual steps
   - Clean startup and shutdown
   - Error handling built-in

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Zero responsive-tiles modifications
- ✅ Same environment variable workflow as staging
- ✅ HTTPS endpoint with self-signed certificates
- ✅ Automated via CLI Quick Start
- ✅ Drop-in replacement achieved
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Type safety maintained
- ✅ Manual tests successful
