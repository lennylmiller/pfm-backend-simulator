# CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FOUND

## Root Cause Identified

After capturing both staging and local simulator responses, I found the issue:

### Staging Backend Response
```json
{
  "partners": [{
    "id": 1,                    // ← NUMBER
    "demo": true,               // ← BOOLEAN
    "domain": "geezeo.geezeo.banno-staging.com",
    "product_name": "My Money Manager",
    "browser_title": "My Money Manager",
    ...
  }]
}
```

### Local Simulator Response
```json
{
  "partners": [{
    "id": "1",                  // ← STRING (BigInt serialized)
    "name": "Fisher - Walter",  // ← Different field name!
    "domain": "rusty-coast.com",
    "product_name": "Fisher - Walter",
    "browser_title": "Fisher - Walter",
    ...
  }]
}
```

## Key Differences

### 1. Field Type: `id`
- **Staging**: `"id": 1` (number)
- **Local**: `"id": "1"` (string)
- **Cause**: BigInt to string serialization in simulator
- **Impact**: Possible parseInt failures or strict equality checks

### 2. Missing Consistency
- Local simulator is generating synthetic data with different values
- Partner names don't match
- Domains don't match

## Current Status

The LOCAL SIMULATOR **IS** RETURNING DATA SUCCESSFULLY:
- ✅ HTTP 200 OK responses
- ✅ Correct JSON structure `{"partners": [...]}`
- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ Snake_case conversion working
- ✅ Response reaches the frontend successfully

However, the app shows "Still processing" with console errors saying "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')".

## Mystery

The browser console fetch I just ran shows the data IS there and correct:
```javascript
{
  hasPartners: true,
  partnersLength: 1,
  firstPartner: { /* all fields present */ },
  firstPartnerKeys: ["id", "name", "domain", ...] // 27 keys
}
```

This means the `/partners/current` API **is working** but something in the frontend's initial bootstrap is failing to process it correctly.

## Next Investigation

Need to understand why the frontend's promise chain is rejecting or losing the response data during initial app bootstrap, even though direct fetch calls work perfectly.

Hypothesis: There may be a race condition or the frontend is making multiple requests and one of them is failing, causing the store initialization to fail.
