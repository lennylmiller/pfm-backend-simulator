# Session Summary - October 2, 2025

## Progress Made

### Phase 1: Stub Endpoints (COMPLETED ✅)
**Objective**: Get app past loading screen by eliminating 404 errors

**Actions Taken**:
1. Created `/src/routes/stubs.ts` with 15 missing API endpoints
2. Added stub routes to main router (`/src/routes/index.ts`)
3. Fixed route conflict with `potential_cashflow` endpoint
   - Moved from stubs to `/src/routes/accounts.ts` to avoid `/:id` pattern conflict

**Results**:
- ✅ All 15 previously missing endpoints now return 200 OK
- ✅ App moved from "Still processing, please come back later" to "Oops! Something went wrong!"
- ✅ No more 404 errors in network requests

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/routes/stubs.ts` (created)
- `/src/routes/index.ts` (added stub routes)
- `/src/routes/accounts.ts` (added `potential_cashflow` route)

### Phase 2: Goals Endpoints with Real Data (COMPLETED ✅)
**Objective**: Replace empty goal stubs with actual data structures

**Actions Taken**:
1. Implemented 4 goal endpoints with full data structures from staging:
   - `GET /users/:userId/payoff_goals` - Returns payoff goal with all fields
   - `GET /users/:userId/savings_goals` - Returns savings goal with all fields
   - `GET /payoff_goals` - Returns 3 payoff goal image options
   - `GET /savings_goals` - Returns 10 savings goal image options

**Results**:
- ✅ Goal endpoints return properly structured JSON matching staging backend
- ❌ App still shows "Oops! Something went wrong!" error

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/routes/stubs.ts` (updated goal endpoints)

### Remaining Issues

**Primary Issue**: App displays "Oops! Something went wrong!" error screen

**Console Errors Observed**:
1. `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')` - Multiple occurrences
2. `Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input`
3. `handleError called {"e":{},"opts":{}}` - Multiple occurrences
4. `config.json` requests failing (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED) - Expected, partner-specific config

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The app is crashing because:
1. Most endpoints still return empty stub data (empty arrays/objects)
2. Frontend code expects properly structured data in these arrays
3. When frontend tries to access array elements or properties, it gets `undefined`
4. This causes JavaScript errors that crash the app into error state

**Specific Problematic Areas**:
- Empty `expenses[]`, `tags[]`, `cashflow_events[]`, etc.
- Frontend likely expects at least minimal data structure in these arrays
- The "Unexpected end of JSON input" suggests potential 204 responses being parsed as JSON

## Next Steps / Recommendations

### Option A: Complete Implementation (Most Thorough)
Implement all remaining endpoints with proper data structures:
1. Cashflow endpoints (calendar data)
2. Expenses endpoint (spending data)
3. Tags endpoints (transaction categories)
4. Networth endpoint (assets/debts)
5. Transactions search endpoint
6. Budgets endpoint
7. Ads endpoint

**Pros**: Full app functionality, complete feature parity
**Cons**: Significant time investment (4-8 hours)

### Option B: Minimal Data Approach (Faster)
Update stub endpoints to return minimal but valid data structures:
- Instead of empty arrays, return arrays with single minimal objects
- Ensure all required fields are present (even if with dummy data)
- Focus on structure correctness, not data realism

**Pros**: Faster (1-2 hours), should get app working
**Cons**: Dashboard will show dummy/minimal data

### Option C: Identify Specific Failing Endpoint (Debugging)
Use browser debugging to identify exactly which endpoint/data structure is causing the crash:
1. Add breakpoints in browser dev tools
2. Step through frontend code to find exact error location
3. Fix only the specific problematic endpoint(s)

**Pros**: Surgical fix, minimal changes
**Cons**: Requires frontend code debugging, may be multiple issues

## Technical Notes

### Route Mounting Order Issue Discovered
The `potential_cashflow` endpoint initially returned 500 errors because:
- It was defined in stubs as `/users/:userId/accounts/potential_cashflow`
- But the accounts router is already mounted on `/users/:userId/accounts`
- The accounts router's `/:id` route matched `potential_cashflow` as an account ID
- **Fix**: Moved the route to accounts.ts and placed it BEFORE the `/:id` route

### Data Structure Requirements
From staging backend captures, goal endpoints require these fields:
- `id`, `name`, `state`, `status`, `percent_complete`
- `target_completion_on`, `image_name`, `image_url`
- `links` object with `accounts` array
- Monetary values as strings: `initial_value`, `current_value`, `target_value`
- `monthly_contribution`, `remaining_monthly_contribution`
- Booleans: `complete`

## Files Created/Modified This Session

**Modified**:
- `/src/routes/index.ts` - Added stub routes import and mounting
- `/src/routes/accounts.ts` - Added potential_cashflow endpoint

**Documentation** (created in previous sessions, referenced):
- `/claudedocs/implementation-plan.md` - Full endpoint list with staging responses

- `/claudedocs/critical-difference-found.md` - Staging vs local comparison

## Conclusion

**Major Achievement**: Successfully eliminated all 404 errors and got the app past the initial loading screen. The app now attempts to render but crashes due to incomplete data structures in stub endpoints.

**Key Insight**: The responsive-tiles frontend requires properly structured data, not just empty arrays. Even if data is minimal/dummy, the structure must be correct for the app to render without crashing.

**Recommended Path Forward**: Option B (Minimal Data Approach) - Update remaining stub endpoints to return minimal but structurally valid data. This should get the dashboard rendering, even if with limited/dummy content.
