# Staging Backend Analysis - Deep Research Findings

## Executive Summary

Through systematic analysis of responsive-tiles connecting to both staging and local simulator backends, we've identified that the frontend code works perfectly with staging but fails with local simulator despite returning apparently identical response structures.

## Working Configuration: Staging Backend

### Environment
- **Backend**: geezeo.geezeo.banno-staging.com
- **Partner ID**: 42
- **App State**: ‚úÖ Fully functional

### Observable Behavior
- Dashboard loads completely with real data
- Cashflow calendar renders with transaction data
- Goals section shows "eSavings" ($5,237.54) and "Pay Off a car"
- Expenses pie chart displays household spending ($1,220)
- No JavaScript errors in console
- All UI elements interactive and responsive

### Network Observations
- Config request: `/assets/config/42/config.json` (404 - expected, optional)
- App loaded data before DevTools capture (indicates fast, successful bootstrap)

## Failing Configuration: Local Simulator

### Environment
- **Backend**: localhost:3000
- **Partner ID**: 1
- **App State**: ‚ùå "Still processing, please come back later"

### Observable Behavior
- App stuck in loading state
- Console errors: `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')"`
- Error occurs at `partnersStore.js:86`: `this.currentPartner = response.partners[0]`
- Multiple `handleError` calls logged

### Network Verification
- All API requests return **200 OK**
- `/api/v2/partners/current` returns **1242 bytes**
- Response structure verified via curl: `{"partners": [{...}]}`
- All required fields present in response
- CORS headers correct
- Authorization headers sent correctly

### Backend Logs Verification
```
[16:22:08 UTC] INFO: GET /current 200
  url: "/api/v2/partners/current"
  res: {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "content-length": "1242"
  }
  responseTime: 23
```

## Critical Question

**Why does identical frontend code work with staging but fail with local simulator?**

Given:
1. ‚úÖ Network requests succeed (200 OK)
2. ‚úÖ Response body has correct structure
3. ‚úÖ All required fields present
4. ‚úÖ CORS configured correctly
5. ‚úÖ Auth headers sent correctly
6. ‚ùå Frontend still gets `undefined` when accessing `response.partners[0]`

## Hypotheses for Root Cause

### Hypothesis 1: Response Processing Difference
The error happens **after** the network request succeeds but **before** the store receives the parsed response. Something in the fetch‚Üíparse‚Üístore chain transforms or loses the response.

**Evidence**:
- Backend logs show 200 OK with correct content-length
- Console shows error at store level (`partnersStore.js:86`)
- Multiple `handleError` calls suggest promise rejections

### Hypothesis 2: Content-Type or Serialization Issue
Staging backend might set different Content-Type headers or use different serialization that the frontend expects.

**Evidence**:
- Simulator returns `application/json; charset=utf-8`
- Need to verify staging backend's exact headers

### Hypothesis 3: Response Field Data Types
While structure matches, individual field **types** might differ (string vs number, null vs undefined, etc.)

**Evidence**:
- Simulator serializes BigInt to strings: `"id": "1"`
- Staging might return: `"id": 42` (number)
- Field type mismatches could cause validation failures in parsing

### Hypothesis 4: Promise Chain Error Handling
The `fetch.js` implementation might have error handling that triggers on specific response characteristics.

**Evidence**:
- Lines 101-119 in fetch.js show complex JWT expiration and error handling
- Multiple code paths that could reject promises
- Error handlers that might transform responses

## Next Steps for Deep Analysis

### 1. Capture Staging Backend Network Traffic (DETAILED)
**Action**: Reload staging app with DevTools Network tab open from start
**Capture**:
- Complete `/partners/current` request
- All request headers
- All response headers
- Response body
- Timing information

### 2. Side-by-Side Header Comparison
**Compare**:
```
Staging:
  Request Headers: [To capture]
  Response Headers: [To capture]

Local Simulator:
  Request Headers: [Known]
  Response Headers: [Known]

Diff: [Identify]
```

### 3. Field-by-Field Data Type Analysis
**Compare**:
- Staging partner object field types
- Local simulator partner object field types
- Identify any type mismatches (string vs number, null vs missing)

### 4. Response Processing Flow Analysis
**Trace**:
1. `fetch()` call in `api/partners.js:4`
2. `checkStatus()` in `api/fetch.js`
3. `parseJSON()` in `api/fetch.js`
4. Store consumption in `partnersStore.js:86`

**Goal**: Identify where `response.partners` becomes `undefined`

## Tools for Next Analysis Session

1. **Chrome DevTools HAR Export**: Capture complete network session from staging
2. **Request Copying**: Copy staging `/partners/current` request as cURL
3. **Response Comparison**: Diff staging vs local responses
4. **Console Logging**: Add debug logs to fetch.js parsing chain

## Current Status

**Staging Backend**: ‚úÖ Proven working reference implementation
**Local Simulator**: ‚ùå Returns correct data but frontend doesn't receive it
**Root Cause**: üîç Likely in response processing chain between network and store

## Recommendation

**Priority 1**: Capture complete staging `/partners/current` request/response with all headers
**Priority 2**: Compare Content-Type, field types, and response processing
**Priority 3**: Identify exact point where `response.partners` becomes undefined
