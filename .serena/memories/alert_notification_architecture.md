# Alert Notification System Architecture - Memory

## Current Implementation Status
- Alert evaluation logic exists in alertEvaluator.ts with 6 alert types
- Database schema has Alert and Notification tables
- Missing: background job infrastructure, email/SMS delivery, notification templates
- Missing: delivery tracking tables, retry logic, monitoring

## Key Design Decisions Made
1. Job Queue: Bull (Redis-backed) for production readiness
2. Email Provider: SendGrid for developer-friendly integration
3. SMS Provider: Twilio for reliability
4. Phased rollout: MVP → Production → Scale → Enterprise
5. Real-time alerts for transaction_limit, batch for others

## Architecture Components
1. Background Job System (Bull + Redis)
2. Alert Evaluation Engine (existing, needs enhancement)
3. Multi-Channel Notification Delivery (email/SMS/in-app)
4. Notification Template Engine
5. Delivery Tracking System
6. Monitoring & Observability Layer
