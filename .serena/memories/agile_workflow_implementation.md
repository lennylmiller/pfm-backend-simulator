# Agile Workflow Implementation Memory

**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Purpose**: Track agile implementation workflow for final 5% completion

## Workflow Summary

Generated comprehensive agile workflow with:
- 5 sprints (Sprint 0-5) over 49-61 days
- Deep analysis of 4 specification documents
- Parallel execution strategy for maximum efficiency
- Quality gates at every sprint boundary

## Sprint Structure

**Sprint 0** (3-4 days): Stabilization - fix 83 failing tests, setup Redis
**Sprint 1** (10 days): Core Infrastructure - rate limiting, pagination (3-4 parallel tracks)
**Sprint 2** (10 days): Integration - update 10 controllers (4 parallel groups)
**Sprint 3** (8 days): Security - JWT blacklist, logout endpoint
**Sprint 4** (12 days): Ads System - database migration + 4 parallel tracks
**Sprint 5** (6 days): QA & Production - comprehensive testing, documentation

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Sprint 1**: 3 tracks (RedisClient, Pagination, Test Infrastructure) â†’ RateLimitMiddleware
**Sprint 2**: 4 controller groups (Financial Core, Goals/Tags, Alerts/Notifications, Cashflow)
**Sprint 4**: 4 tracks after migration (AdService, AdsController, Serializer/Routes, Seed Generator)

**Efficiency Gain**: ~50% faster than sequential execution

## Key Quality Gates

- 100% test pass rate at every sprint
- Code coverage >80% for new code
- Performance benchmarks: <5ms middleware overhead
- Security: 0 critical vulnerabilities
- API compliance: 100% Geezeo v2 spec

## Risk Management

Top 3 risks:
1. Test stabilization delays (Medium/High) - buffer time allocated
2. Redis connection issues (Low/High) - retry logic + fallback
3. Merge conflicts (Medium/Medium) - frequent merges, clear ownership

## Success Metrics

- **Timeline**: 49-61 days (4-5 weeks)
- **Team Size**: 4-5 developers optimal
- **Performance**: <200ms avg response time
- **Quality**: >80% code coverage, 100% test pass rate

## Next Steps

1. Team review and approval
2. Assemble 4-5 developer team
3. Execute Sprint 0 (test stabilization)
4. Begin Sprint 1 with parallel tracks
